mxgraph
=======

mxGraph is a fully client side JavaScript diagramming library that uses SVG and HTML for rendering. [draw.io](https://www.draw.io) is an example that extends the functionality of this library. The [sources to draw.io](https://github.com/jgraph/draw.io) are also available.

Note this is the release repo. The development repo is on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/jgraph/mxgraph2). Submit PRs there.

If you want to build something like draw.io, [GraphEditor](https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/javascript/examples/grapheditor/www/index.html) is the best example to use as a base.

The npm build is [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mxgraph)

mxGraph supports IE 11, Chrome 43+, Firefox 45+, Safari 9.1.x, 10.1.x and 11.0.x, Opera 30+, Native Android browser 5.1.x+, the default browser in the current and previous major iOS versions (e.g. 11.x and 10.x) and Edge 31+.

mxGraph uses no third-party software, it requires no plugins and can be integrated in virtually any framework.

History
=======

We created mxGraph in 2005 as a commercial project and it ran through to 2016 that way. Our USP was the support for non-SVG browsers, when that advantage expired we moved onto commercial activity around draw.io. mxGraph is pretty much feature complete, production tested in many large enterprises and stable for many years. We actively fix bugs and make minor improvements since it comprises the base of our draw.io stack.
