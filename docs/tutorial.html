<h1><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h1>
<p>
  The mxGraph package contains a client software, written in JavaScript, and a series
  of backends for various languages. The client software is a graph component with
  an optional application wrapper that is integrated into an existing web interface.
  The client requires a webserver to deliver the required files to the client or
  can be run from the local filesystem without a webserver. The backends may be used
  as is, or they may be embedded into an existing server application in one of the
  supported languages.
</p>
<img src="images/architecture.png">
<p>
  If a backend exists, then the client may be configured to use this backend in
  various ways, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating images</li>
  <li>Storing and loading diagrams</li>
  <li>Creating an object representation of a graph</li>
  <li>Sharing diagrams with other clients</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The above scenarios maybe combined in various ways, such as sending an XML 
  description of each change to the backend as it happens, or autosaving of
  the diagram to avoid loss of data on the client. The client can also operate in
  offline mode, where it does not require a backend or a webserver.
</p>
<p>
  Please have a look at the index files in the respective directories for
  information on the various backends.

<h1><a name="HelloWorld"></a>Hello, World!</h1>
<p>
  The Hello, World! example of mxGraph ships in a 
  single <a href="../javascript/examples/helloworld.html">HTML file</a>,
  which contains the required namespaces, the mxGraph library script
  and the example code. The example can be viewed by pointing Firefox or
  Internet Explorer to the link above either on the local
  filesystem or on a webserver. To display the source of the example
  press Control-U in Firefox or click Page, View Source in Internet Explorer.
</p>
<h2><a name="Library"></a>Library</h2>
<p>
  The HEAD part of the page contains the JavaScript code and dependencies.
  The library is loaded using the following code. The  <code>mxBasePath</code> 
  variable is used to define the path where the library loads its resources
  from. This variable must be defined prior to loading the library code and
  should not include a trailing slash.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  mxBasePath = 'javascript/src';
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="javascript/src/js/mxClient.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  <code>mxClient.js</code> contains all required code in a single file. Note
  that the source code only ships with the commercial distributions. In the
  evaluation version, the source code is loaded from a server using a special
  URL. You should not make local copies of the evaluation source code.
</p>
<h2><a name="BrowserCheck"></a>Browser Check</h2>
<p>
  The next script tag in the HEAD part of the page contains the
  Hello, World! example code. The first part of the code checks if the
  browser that is displaying the page is supported by the library. It is
  recommended to do this as the first step of the program and
  display an error message if the browser is not supported. In your
  document you may also want to include a NOSCRIPT directive for
  browsers that have JavaScript disabled, however, in our examples this
  directive is not used.
</p>
<p>
  There is no convention for the name of the main function. The function
  is invoked from the <code>onload</code> handler in the page and may have any name 
  and arguments. In this case, the argument is a  DOM node that will contain
  the graph. Note that the DOM node may have any ID and that the code
  is independent of this ID.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript";&gt;
function main(container)
{
  // Checks if the browser is supported
  if (!mxClient.isBrowserSupported())
  {
    // Displays an error message if the browser is not supported.
    mxUtils.error('Browser is not supported!', 200, false);
  }
  ...
</pre>
<h2><a name="Container"></a>Container</h2>
<p>
  For the JavaScript to actually render the graph, the page 
  contains an DOM node which will display the graph. This
  DOM node is either dynamically created or it is obtained via 
  an ID using <code>document.getElementById</code> as in the
  Hello, World! example. The DOM node is passed to the main
  function and is used to construct the graph instance as shown
  below.
</p>
<p>
  If you want the container to have scrollbars, use the overflow:auto CSS
  directive instead of overflow:hidden in the style of the container.
</p>
<h2><a name="Graph"></a>Graph</h2>
<p>
  The code constructs an empty graph model and passes the container
  and the empty model to the graph constructor. For this example,
  all default event handling is disabled in the last line.
</p>
<pre>
var model = new mxGraphModel();
var graph = new mxGraph(container, model);
</pre>
<p>
	If you want the graph to be read-only you can use <code>graph.setEnabled(false)</code>.
</p>
<h2><a name="VerticesAndEdges"></a>Vertices and Edges</h2>
<p>
  To insert vertices and edges, <code>beginUpdate</code> and <code>endUpdate</code>
  are used to create a transaction. The <code>endUpdate</code> should always go
  into a finally-block to make sure it is always executed if the <code>beginUpdate</code>
  was executed. However, the <code>beginUpdate</code> should not be part of the
  try-block to make sure <code>endUpdate</code> is never executed if <code>beginUpdate</code>
  fails. This is required for the model to remain in a consistent state, that is, for
  each call to <code>beginUpdate</code> there should always be exactly one call to
  <code>endUpdate</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The part within the try-block creates the vertices and edges for the graph.
  The default parent is obtained from the graph and is typically the first
  child of the root cell in the model, which is created automatically when
  using the graph model c'tor with no arguments.
</p>
<pre>
// Gets the default parent for inserting new cells. This
// is normally the first child of the root (ie. layer 0).
var parent = graph.getDefaultParent();
        
// Adds cells to the model in a single step
model.beginUpdate();
try
{
  var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello,', 20, 20, 80, 30);
  var v2 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'World!', 200, 150, 80, 30);
  var e1 = graph.insertEdge(parent, null, '', v1, v2);
}
finally
{
  // Updates the display
  model.endUpdate();
}
</pre>
<p>
  The use of <code>beginUpdate</code> and <code>endUpdate</code> does not
  only improve the display performance, but it is also used to mark the
  boundaries for undoable changes when undo/redo is used.
</p>
<h1><a name="Graphs"></a>Graphs</h1>
<p>
  Instantiate <a href="js-api/files/view/mxGraph-js.html">mxGraph</a>
  in order to create a graph. This is the central class in the API. 
  Everything else is auxiliary.
</p>
<img src="images/graph.png">
<p>
  To create a new graph instance, a DOM node (typically a DIV) is
  required:
</p>
<pre>
var node = document.getElementById('id-of-graph-container');
var graph = new mxGraph(node);
</pre>
<h2><a name="Model"></a>Model</h2>
<p>
  <a href="js-api/files/model/mxCell-js.html">mxCell</a> defines the 
  elements of the graph model, which is implemented by
  <a href="js-api/files/model/mxGraphModel-js.html">mxGraphModel</a>.
</p>
<img src="images/model.png">
<p>
  The graph model has the following properties:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The root element of the graph contains the layers. 
    The parent of each layer is the root element.
  </li>
  <li>
    A layer may contain elements of the graph model, 
    namely vertices, edges and groups.
  </li>
  <li>
    Groups may contain elements of the graph model,
    recursively.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The graph and structural information is stored in the cells, as well as the
  <i>user objects</i>, which are used to store the <i>value</i> associated with
  the cells (aka business objects).
</p>
<p>
  To create a new graph model with a root cell and a default layer (first child):
</p>
<pre>
var root = new mxCell();
root.insert(new mxCell());
var model = new mxGraphModel(root);
</pre>
<h2><a name="Stylesheet"></a>Stylesheet</h2>
<p>
  The appearance of the cells in a graph is defined by the
  stylesheet, which is an instance of
  <a href="js-api/files/view/mxStylesheet-js.html">
  mxStylesheet</a>.
  The stylesheet maps from stylenames to styles.
  A style is an array of key, value pairs to be 
  used with the cells. The keys are defined in 
  <a href="js-api/files/util/mxConstants-js.html">
  mxConstants</a> and the values may be
  strings and numbers or JavaScript objects or functions.
</p>
<p>
  To modify the default styles for vertices and edges in an existing graph:
</p>
<pre>
var vertexStyle = graph.getStylesheet().getDefaultVertexStyle();
vertexStyle[mxConstants.ROUNDED] = true;

var edgeStyle = graph.getStylesheet().getDefaultEdgeStyle();
edgeStyle[mxConstants.STYLE_EDGE] = mxEdgeStyle.TopToBottom;
</pre>
<h2><a name="Styles"></a>Styles</h2>
<p>
  The style information for a cell is stored in <code>cell.style</code>.
  The style is part of the cell's state and is normally changed via 
  <code>mxGraphModel.setStyle</code>, which will update all views.
  The cell style is a string of the form
</p>
<pre>
[stylename;|key=value;]
</pre>
<p>
  which tells the graph to use the given named styles and override the
  specified key, value pairs in the given order. For example, to use the
  <a href="js-api/files/view/mxStylesheet-js.html#mxStylesheet.putCellStyle">rounded</a>
  style and override the stroke- and fillColor, the style would be defined as:
</p>
<pre>
rounded;strokeColor=red;fillColor=green
</pre>
<p>
  To use the above in Hello, World!, the stylename would be passed to the 
  insertVertex method as follows:
</p>
<pre>
var v1 = graph.insertVertex(parent, null, 'Hello',
  20, 20, 80, 30, 'rounded;strokeColor=red;fillColor=green');
</pre>
<h2><a name="Appearance"></a>Appearance</h2>
<p>
  In certain cases you may want to override specific attributes based on 
  dynamic properties of a cell (ie. it's value, aka. userobject), such as 
  the image, indicator shape, -image, -color or -gradient color), in
  which case you can override <code>getImage</code>, 
  <code>getIndicatorShape</code>, <code>getIndicatorImage</code>,
  <code>getIndicatorColor</code> and <code>getIndicatorGradientColor</code> 
  respectively. Note that these methods take a cell state as an argument, 
  which points to a "resolved" (that is, an array) version of the
  cell's style. Hence, the default implementation for <code>getImage</code> 
  looks as follows:
</p>
<pre>
mxGraph.prototype.getImage = function(state)
{
  if (state != null &amp;&amp; state.style != null)
  {
    return state.style[mxConstants.STYLE_IMAGE];
  }
  return null;
}
</pre>
<p>
  This method may be overridden to return any image for the given state. 
  Typically, the image is defined by either <code>state.cell</code>, 
  which points to the graph cell associated with the state, or by
  <code>state.cell.value</code>, which refers to the cell's user object.
</p>
<p>
  Due to the nature of the display, where all cells are created once and 
  updated only if the model fires a notification for a change, you must 
  invoke <code>view.invalidate(cell)</code> for each cell who's image
  has changed, and call <code>view.validate</code> to update the display.
</p>
<h1><a name="Editors"></a>Editors</h1>
<p>
  Instantiate <a href="js-api/files/editor/mxEditor-js.html">mxEditor</a> in
  order to create an editor. This is the central class in the editor
  package. Everything else in this package is auxiliary.
  To create a new editor instance and configure it using a config
  file, you can pass the name of the config file to the
  <a href="js-api/files/editor/mxEditor-js.html#mxEditor.mxEditor">mxEditor constructor</a>.
</p>
<img src="images/editor.png">
<p>
  To create a new editor instance and configure it, the following code is used:
</p>
<pre>
var config = mxUtils.load('editors/config/keyhandler-commons.xml').getDocumentElement();
var editor = new mxEditor(config);
</pre>
<p>
  The configuration file is an XML file that is passed to 
  <a href="js-api/files/io/mxCodec-js.html">mxCodec</a>, which in
  turn uses <a href="js-api/files/io/mxEditorCodec-js.html">mxEditorCodec</a>
  and others to read the XML into the editor object hierarchy. This is normally
  done at startup time to configure the editor, graph, model, toolbar, popupmenus
  etc using the <a href="#InputOutput">I/O subsystem</a>.
</p>
<h2><a name="CSS"></a>CSS</h2>
<p>
  The CSS stylesheet contains the style definitions for various
  elements of the user interface, such as the rubberband selection,
  the in-place editor or the popup menu. It also contains the directives 
  required to enable VML support in Internet Explorer, so it is substantial
  that the stylesheet is included in the page.
</p>
<p>
  Additional stylesheets may either be added programmatically using
  <code>mxClient.link('stylesheet', filename)</code> or
  via a stylesheet tag of the UI section in the editor configuration, eg.:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;mxEditor&gt;
  &lt;ui&gt;
    &lt;stylesheet name="examples/editors/css/process.css"/&gt;
    ...
</pre>
<h2><a name="Templates"></a>Templates</h2>
<p>
  To add new cell types, create a template in the templates array section of 
  the model in the config file (mxEditor/mxGraph/mxGraphModel/Array[as=templates]) 
  as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;add as="symbol"&gt;
  &lt;Symbol label="Symbol" customAttribute="whatever"&gt;
    &lt;mxCell vertex="1" connectable="1" style="symbol;image=images/event.png"&gt;    
      &lt;mxGeometry as="geometry" width="32" height="32"/&gt;
    &lt;/mxCell&gt;
    &lt;CustomChild customAttribute="whatever"/&gt;
  &lt;/Symbol&gt;
&lt;/add&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>as</code>-attribute of the <code>add</code>-element contains the 
  name under which the template will be accessible for later use. The 
  <code>Symbol</code>-child element is a custom (ie workflow) element, and 
  can have any name and any number of child elements and custom attributes. 
  The label attribute is a special one that is used for the textual 
  representation of the cell in the graph. The <code>mxCell</code> element
  is another special child node which contains the graphical information for 
  the cell, namely, the cell-type, -style, -size and -position.
</p>
<p>
  See mxGraph.convertValueToString if you would like to use another 
  attribute or a combination of attributes for the textual representation, 
  and <code>mxCell.valueChanged</code> to handle in-place editing by storing 
  the new text value in the respective attribute(s).
</p>
<h2><a name="Toolbar"></a>Toolbar</h2>
<p>
  To use the template in the graph, a toolbar item must be added which refers 
  to the template in the mxDefaultToolbar section of the config file 
  (mxEditor/mxDefaultToolbar[as=toolbar]) as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;add as="symbolTool" template="symbol"
  style="symbol;image=wf/images/bpmn/special_event.png"
  icon="wf/images/bpmn/small_event.gif"/&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  The <code>as</code> attribute specifies the tooltip to be displayed for the 
  icon in the toolbar, the <code>template</code>-attribute refers to the name 
  under which the template was previously added. The <code>style</code>-
  attribute is optional, and may be used to override the style defined in the 
  template definition. Finally, the icon specifies the icon to be used for the 
  toolbar item.
</p>
<p>
  Note that the <code>as</code> attribute is assumed to be the key for a language
  resource, in this case <code>symbolTool</code>. If the resource is not defined
  in <a href="js-api/files/util/mxResources-js.html">mxResources</a>, then the
  attribute value is used as the label.
</p>
<h1><a name="InputOutput"></a>Input/Output</h1>
<p>
  The default encoding scheme maps all non-object fields to string
  attributes and all object fields to child nodes, using the constructor
  name of the object as the nodename and the fieldname for the as-attribute
  value. This default encoding scheme may be overridden by custom codecs,
  which are registered in the
  <a href="js-api/files/io/mxCodecRegistry-js.html">mxCodecRegistry</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, consider the following JavaScript object definition:
</p>
<pre>
var object = new Object();
object.myBool = true;
object.myObject = new Object();
object.myObject.name = 'Test';
object.myArray = ['a', ['b', 'c'], 'd'];
</pre>
<p>
  To encode this object and show the resulting XML in a new window,
  the following code is used:
</p>
<pre>
var encoder = new mxCodec();
var node = encoder.encode(object);
mxUtils.popup(mxUtils.getXml(node));
</pre>
<p>
  And here is the XML structure that represents the object:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;Object myBool="1"&gt;
  &lt;Object name="Test" as="myObject"/&gt;
  &lt;Array as="myArray"&gt;
    &lt;add value="a"/&gt;
    &lt;Array&gt;
      &lt;add value="b"/&gt;
      &lt;add value="c"/&gt;
    &lt;/Array&gt;
    &lt;add value="d"/&gt;
  &lt;/Array&gt;
&lt;/Object&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Note that the codecs will turn booleans into numeric values, no
  array indices are stored if they are numeric and non-object
  array members are stored inside the value-attribute.
  Furthermore one may include other XML files by
  use of the <code>include</code> directive in the XML structures.
</p>
<h2><a name="Files"></a>Files</h2>
<p>
  The save, open, readGraphModel and writeGraphModel functions
  implement a standard mechanism for handling files in
  <a href="js-api/files/editor/mxEditor-js.html">mxEditor</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The default implementation of <code>mxEditor.save</code> is called
  with an argument to indicate if the save was triggered by the user or
  by the system. It then uses the <code>urlPost</code> variable of
  the editor object to check if a post request should be issued. If
  the variable is defined, the editor issues a post request to the
  specified URL passing the XML along as a POST variable called xml.
</p>
<h2><a name="Post"></a>Post</h2>
<p>
  As an example, consider the following PHP file which is located
  in the same directory as the HTML page. If the filename is server.php
  then the urlPost variable must be set to server.php on the editor
  in order to post the diagram to the server. The PHP file will get
  the XML from the POSt request and write it to a file called
  diagram.xml.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;?php 
$xml = $HTTP_POST_VARS['xml'];
if ($xml != null) {
  $fh=fopen("diagram.xml","w");
  fputs($fh, stripslashes($xml)); 
  fclose($fh);
}
?&gt;
</pre>
<p>
  To set the URL to post to, change the respective entry in the mxEditor node of the config file as follows:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;mxEditor urlPost="http://www.example.com/server.php" ... &gt;
</pre>
<p>
  Keep in mind that the JavaScript can only post to the server where it originated from, so we recommend
  to use relative URLs, eg. server.php.
</p>
<h2><a name="FormFields"></a>Form Fields</h2>
<p>
  If you need to read/write the graph from/to a string (eg. to fill a form-field), you can use the 
  following methods:
</p>
<pre>
var data = editor.writeGraphModel();
editor.readGraphModel(mxUtils.parseXml(data));
</pre>
<h2><a name="Codecs"></a>Codecs</h2>
<p>
  For encoding other objects, or if no editor instance is available,
  the <a href="js-api/files/io/mxCodec-js.html">mxCodec</a> can be 
  used to create and read XML data.
